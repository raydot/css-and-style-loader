<ul>
	<li>Loaders are Node-based utilities that help Webpack load non-js files</li>
	<li><strong>css-loader</strong> is the npm module that helps webpack collect CSS from all of the CSS files referenced in your application as a single string.</li>
	<li><strong>style-loader</strong> takes that string and puts it inside the <code><style></code> tags in your app's index.html file.</li>
</ul>
